  ##**MOTIVATION**
  
   As I progressed through the Google Developers' Machine Learning Crash Course, I decided to put the machine learning concepts into practice by coding models in tf.keras. I have used Colab as a programming environment (Colab is Google's version of Jupyter Notebook). Like Jupyter Notebook, Colab provides an interactive Python programming environment that combines text, code, graphics, and program output.
  
  
  ##**About the DATASET**
    
   The dataset for this practice session has been based on the 1990 census data from California and although, this dataset is old but still, it provides a great opportunity to learn about machine learning programming.
    
   The features/label(s) of the .csv file holding the California Housing Dataset are emphasized under parenthesis as 

_"longitude","latitude","housing_median_age","total_rooms","total_bedrooms","population","households","median_income"_: some are used as features from here,
_"median_house_value"_: used as a label (target for task-driven supervised model).
