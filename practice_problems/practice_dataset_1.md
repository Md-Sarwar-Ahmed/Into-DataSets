#1990 US Census - California Housing Data Set/

  **MOTIVATION**
  
   As I progressed through the Google Developers' Machine Learning Crash Course, I decided to put the machine learning concepts into practice by coding models in tf.keras. I have used Colab as a programming environment (Colab is Google's version of Jupyter Notebook). Like Jupyter Notebook, Colab provides an interactive Python programming environment that combines text, code, graphics, and program output.
  
  **About the DATASET**
    
   The dataset for this practice session hase been based on the 1990 census data from California and although, this dataset is old but still, it provides a great opportunity to learn about machine learning programming.
    
   Some of the rows of the .csv file file holding the California Housing Dataset:
